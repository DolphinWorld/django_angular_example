# django_angular_example
This is to follow: http://devarea.com/building-a-simple-website-with-angular-4-and-django-and-deploy-it-to-heroku/#.WwZY2VMvy-p

Some difference:

1. Not using heroku
2. For static js, we copied the file to the application/static folder, eg: first/static
3. js file names are a little bit different from the sample, we copied it from dist/testapp
