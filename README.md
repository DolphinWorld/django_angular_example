# django_angular_keras_example

This project is demo how to integrate Angular 4 with DJango, and Keras.

This is to follow: http://devarea.com/building-a-simple-website-with-angular-4-and-django-and-deploy-it-to-heroku/#.WwZY2VMvy-p

Some difference:

### Not using heroku
### For static js, we copied the file to the application/static folder, eg: first/static
### js file names are a little bit different from the sample, we copied it from dist/testapp
